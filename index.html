					<p>Meet Smart Kx - the <u>only</u> client contract manager and billing solution designed for RIAs.</p>
					<p class="h4">This revolutionary technology provides an integrated solution for Registered Investment Advisors that delivers fee accuracy, and clearly defines your firm’s recurring revenue.</p>
					<p>By using Smart Kx technology, Registered Investment Advisors will:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Accurately report recurring revenue.</li>
						<li>Eliminate the possibility of fee inconsistencies.</li>
						<li>Reduce regulatory risk and exposure.</li>
						<li>Significantly increase billing efficiency.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Investment fee calculation can be a costly, inefficient, and daunting process, which limits fee calculation methods.</strong> With Smart Kx, your fees become part of a system that is programmable to any billing structure needed - simple or complex. The Smart Kx interface uses the legal contract to code the fee calculator, thereby eliminating the possibility of error. Fee calculations are indisputable and fully accessible in real time - at any time - with just a few clicks. Current billing solutions for RIA’s may generate impressive reports, but they do not provide contract fee accuracy assurance – thus leaving your firm’s revenue subject to error, costly scrutiny, and compliance risk. Finally, advisory fee review and quarterly billing constraints are a thing of the past.</p>
					<p><strong>The Smart Kx service eliminates potential billing inconsistencies by providing a seamless fee calculation system based on the terms of the contract.</strong> With Smart Kx, the legal contract between the firm and client acts as a robust, dynamic, and autonomous calculator. Smart Kx ensures the contract <u>and</u> the fee are both exactly as agreed, which eliminates any need for time-consuming manual calculation and review.</p>
					<p><strong>Thanks to Smart Kx, your RIA firm’s revenues are protected, completely transparent, and proven on an immutable ledger.</strong> Smart Kx delivers peace of mind for RIA’s, regulators, AND clients by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Clearly defining and accurately reporting the firm’s recurring revenue.</li>
						<li>Efficiently and accurately calculating contract fees at any time.</li>
						<li>Fully disclosing the fee calculation.</li>
						<li>Eliminating the need for costly reviews and audits for fees, account statements, and client contracts.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Registered Investment Advisors’ fee compliance has never been easier, and your advisory fees and expense compliance are finally assured.</strong> If you’re ready for a system that <u>guarantees fee transparency</u>, accuracy, and peace of mind.</p>

		<p class="para fit">Smart Kx is a contract management software built for RIAs streamlining the client contract, fee calculation and audit process.</p>
		<p class="para fit">With the Smart Kx solution, the traditional legal contract between the client and the firm is both the contract and the fee calculator.  This ensures the fee is calculated exactly as the firm and the client have agreed.  An audit of the client contract, account statement and invoice is no longer required as the fee cannot differ from the contract terms.</p>
		<p class="para fit">Additionally, the contract, fee and its calculation are stored on an immutable ledger, allowing the firm to prove with absolute certainty what amount was billed, on what date and the calculation used.  There is no change to the firm's legal contract or the client experience; both parties sign a traditional legal contract in hardcopy or electronic versions.  This solution also addresses and solves a majority of the recent <a class="text-light" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/ocie-risk-alert-advisory-fee-expense-compliance.pdf">SEC Risk Alert.</a></p> -->
