		<p class="para">Smart Kx is a contract management software built for RIAs streamlining the client contract, fee calculation and audit process.</p>
		<p class="para">With the Smart Kx solution, the traditional legal contract between the client and the firm is both the contract and the fee calculator.  This ensures the fee is calculated exactly as the firm and the client have agreed.  An audit of the client contract, account statement and invoice is no longer required as the fee cannot differ from the contract terms.</p>
		<p class="para">Additionally, the contract, fee and its calculation are stored on an immutable ledger, allowing the firm to prove with absolute certainty what amount was billed, on what date and the calculation used.  There is no change to the firm's legal contract or the client experience; both parties sign a traditional legal contract in hardcopy or electronic versions.  This solution also addresses and solves a majority of the recent <a class="text-light" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/ocie-risk-alert-advisory-fee-expense-compliance.pdf">SEC Risk Alert.</a></p>
